# Airbnb Price Prediction and Data Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and machine learning pipeline for predicting the price of Airbnb listings based on various features. The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature selection, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using several regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

## Overview

This project analyzes the Airbnb dataset to predict the price of listings based on several factors like property type, room type, number of bedrooms, and amenities. The analysis also includes handling missing data, feature engineering, and employing machine learning models to assess their performance in predicting the log-transformed price of listings.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* xgboost
* keras
* matplotlib-venn
* statsmodels


## Data Analysis

The analysis begins by importing the dataset and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA). Some key points in the analysis are:

* **Missing Data Imputation**: Missing values in columns like 'bathrooms', 'bedrooms', and 'review_scores_rating' are imputed using different strategies based on their correlations with other features.
* **Distribution of Features**: Histograms and box plots are used to analyze the distribution of features such as 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', and 'number_of_reviews'.
* **Feature Engineering**: Interaction terms are created, and numerical features are scaled for modeling.
* **Visualization**: Various plots, such as bar plots and Venn diagrams, are used to visualize the missing data, categorical feature distribution, and correlations.

## Feature Engineering

### Missing Value Imputation

* Missing values in columns like 'bathrooms', 'bedrooms', and 'beds' are imputed using group-based imputation techniques based on 'property_type' and 'room_type'.
* If missing values still remain after group-based imputation, the overall median is used.

### Encoding Categorical Features

* Categorical features are encoded using One-Hot Encoding for machine learning models.

### Numerical Features

* Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler to normalize their range for training models.

## Modeling

The project uses multiple regression models to predict the price of Airbnb listings:

* **Linear Regression**
* **Random Forest Regressor**
* **XGBoost Regressor**
* **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
* **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

For each model, the following steps are performed:

1. **Cross-Validation**: Cross-validation is used to evaluate model performance.
2. **Model Fitting**: Models are trained using the training data.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.

## Results

The results of model evaluation are compared using the following metrics:

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
* **R² Score**

The models are evaluated using both cross-validation and test set performance. The results are summarized in a DataFrame, and feature importance is visualized for models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting.

### Example Results:

| Model             | MSE   | R² Score |
| ----------------- | ----- | -------- |
| Linear Regression | 45.32 | 0.89     |
| Random Forest     | 34.54 | 0.92     |
| XGBoost           | 32.11 | 0.93     |
| Gradient Boosting | 36.12 | 0.91     |
| ANN               | 28.75 | 0.95     |

### Feature Importance:

The following features are found to be most important for predicting Airbnb prices:

* 'bedrooms'
* 'bathrooms'
* 'property_type'
* 'room_type'
